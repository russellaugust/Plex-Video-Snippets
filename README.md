# Plex Snippets

Ever wanted to save a funny moment you were watching on tv?  Or grab a clip from a movie to remix later?

Now you can capture it!

This is built to run alongside Plex using Flask.

Go to the server's path (set by Flask) and you'll get a list of what's currently playing.  Click on the content you want to capture and it'll save an MP4 to a pre set locations (mine is Dropbox).  

Future goals with this is to get a better way to server up the information, possibly setting up a RESTful API.  Also looking into how to connect it cleanly with something like Apple Shortcuts.

Any input or thoughts is very welcome!
