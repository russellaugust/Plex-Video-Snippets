# Plex Video Snippets (Version 2)

This is a program I built that runs alongside Plex using Flask.  

The purpose is that if you ever are watching a tv show or movie and something funny happens, you can capture it!  Go to the server's path (set by Flask) and you'll get a list of what's currently playing.  Click on the content you want to capture and it'll save an MP4 to a pre set locations (mine is Dropbox).
